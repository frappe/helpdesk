Fixes #2629

## Description
Adds the ability to react to comments with multiple emojis. This allows users to acknowledge comments without creating additional replies, reducing ticket clutter.

## Problem Solved
When someone is tagged in a comment for informational purposes, they previously had two options:
1. Add a new comment to acknowledge (clutters the ticket)
2. Read without responding (no acknowledgement)

Now users can simply react with emojis to acknowledge they've seen the comment.

## Changes

### Backend
- New child table DocType `HD Comment Reaction` to store reactions inside comments
- Added `reactions` Table field to `HD Ticket Comment`
- API: `toggle_reaction(comment, emoji)` - add/remove reaction
- API: `get_reactions(comment)` - get reactions grouped by emoji with user info
- Notification sent to comment author when someone reacts

### Frontend
- Added emoji picker with 8 common emojis: 👍 👎 ❤️ 😄 🎉 😕 👀 🚀
- Shows all reactions below each comment with counts
- Hover tooltip displays who has reacted
- Users can add multiple different reactions to same comment
- Clicking same emoji again removes it (toggle)

## Implementation Details
- Follows Gameplan pattern with child table inside comment
- Real-time updates via websocket events
- One user can have multiple reactions (different emojis) on same comment

## Testing
1. Open any ticket with comments
2. Click the 😊 emoji picker button below a comment
3. Select any emoji (e.g., 👍)
4. Select another emoji (e.g., ❤️) - both should appear
5. Click 👍 again to remove it
6. Hover over reactions to see who reacted
